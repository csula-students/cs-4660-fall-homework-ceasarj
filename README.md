# CS-4660 Artificial Intelligence.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/csula/cs4660-fall-2016.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/csula/cs4660-fall-2016)

Welcome to CS-4660 -- the introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI).

We will learn a couple approaches of solving general problems by utilizing Graph
as data structure and implementing searching algorithms like BFS(Bread-First Search),
DFS(Depth-First search) and some other search algorithm to find out the best
action(s) for the problem.

More specifically, we will be implementing our own Graph data structure
and then using this data structure to implement BFS, DFS, A-star searching algorithm
and as well as other searching algorithms.

Why Graph?

Graph can be used to solve general problems such as path finding or
some advanced problem solving (e.g. being able to play games like chess). In other
word, graph is useful for solving problems!

By the end of class, you should be able to apply our Graph class to solve problems!

## Prerequisites

This is a 400 level course -- which means students are expected to have strong
programming background (especially Java).

Secondly, although not required but I recommend you to use text-editors like
[Atom](https://atom.io/) or [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for your
programming environment.

Or if you wish to use programming IDE, I recommend using
[IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)!

Last but not lease, we will be going over the examples in class with terminal,
please be familiar with using command line interface such as git.

## Get Started

This Java repository uses Gradle the dependency management tool. Thus, you can
build the project by `gradle clean build`

## Announcements

Please check this Github repository often as the update will be posted.
