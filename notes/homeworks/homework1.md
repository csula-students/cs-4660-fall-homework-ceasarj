## Description

**Graph Representation**

* Being able to read from file (Java IO)
* Utilize interface/abstract class (Object Oriented)

In this homework, you will start your assignment just like exercise before. You will need to read from file, parse information line by line and store them correctly. Eventually, you will implement methods to use those variables.

You will need to implement/modify three files (`AdjacencyList.java`, `AdjacencyMatrix.java` and `ObjectOriented.java` under `src/main/java/csula/cs460/graphs/strategy`).

In these three classes, you will be implementing similar methods for graph (e.g. `adjacent`, `neighbors` or `addNode` ... etc. you can check these method description out under `Graph.java`) but with different data structure.

Please review the note from lesson 1 - knowledge representation for differences of these three way of representing graph.

**Input format**

```
4
0:3:4
1:2:1
2:3:4
3:1:2
```

First line is the total number of nodes.

> In this homework, we will create node with unique id starting from 0  
> In other word, if we have four nodes; they are node 0, 1, 2, 3

Starting from second line, you will get `fromNode`:`toNode`:`value` for each edge.

Your job is to parse these lines of edges and add them into graph.

## Tasks

1. Read graph from file
2. Verify code by looking at graph
3. Visualize graph [Optional]

## Deliverable

* `AdjacencyList.java`, `AdjacencyMatrix.java` and `ObjectOriented` under graph/strategy package
* Github Pull Requests (be sure to pass all unit tests)

## Grading Rubric

* Pass unit tests [10 pts]
* Bonus Question - visualize graph [2 pts]
