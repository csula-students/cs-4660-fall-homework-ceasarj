Homework 4 is a sub-part of the project.

See [the project note](../project.md) for the detail on the implementation ...

## Description

In this homework, I need you to submit a pull request containing your changes 
and what you did so far.

I'll be going over each person one by one to ask you to explain your source code
to me in class. 

This explanation will require to do a 3 minutes presentation to me on what is
your current accomplishment (your source code), what problem you are stuck on,
what are you going to work on in the remaining time.

After your 3 minutes presentation, I'll be asking question in the coming 2 mintues.
Questions may include but not limited to:

* How you implement certain solution (like minimax or how you store the board state)?
* What other strategy you impelment?
* What method takes longest?
* What are possible improvements to your code?

For the presentation template, you may follow this:

And after the QA is done, please submit your Pull request as usual to homework 4
section on CSNS.
