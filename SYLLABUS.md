# Artificial Intelligence

## Course Overview

- **Objective** The primary objective of this course is to introduce knowledge representation, problem solving and learning methods of Artificial Intelligence. Furthermore, students will be learning how to apply such techniques into games.
- **Expectation** Students are expected to have Java programming background as the entire course will be primary taught in Java. In addition, students are expected to devote a large amount of time learning how to implement algorithms learned in class.

## Logistics

- **Instructor** Hsiang-Yu (Eric) Liao [rcliao01@gmail.com](mailto:rcliao01@gmail.com)
- **Lecture** Saturday 8:00 AM to 10:45 AM
- **Office Hours** Saturday 10:45 AM to 12:00 PM or online 24/7
- **Office Hours Location** Either at the classroom (E&T A309 or library -- see notes below)
- **Location** E&T A309
- **Text Book** None as we will have all notes hosted on Github.

> As the university notice, we (part-time lecturers) can use the library room --
Palmer Wing room 2097 -- for the office hour purpose.

> Thus, if you don't find me at the classroom, please find me at library.

## Course Objectives

* Knowledge Representation (Graph, Node and Edge)
* Brute force searching algorithm (DFS & BFS)
* Heuristic searching algorithm (A*)
* Alpha-Beta pruning
* Min-Max
* Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)

## Grading Allocation

1. Quiz (4) 40 pts
2. Homework (4) 40 pts
3. Course Project 20 pts
4. Attendance 5 pts

**Final Project** Homework assignments culminate in a final project: a complete application/game that utilizes the AI theories. **Successful completion of the course project is a requirement for passing this course.**

## Grading Scale

* A: 94 to 100
* A-: 90 to 93
* B+: 85 to 89
